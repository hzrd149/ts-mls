# Remove

This scenario demonstrates how a member can be removed from a group and how the remaining members update their state. It shows the group epoch transitions and how removal proposals and commits are processed.

## Steps Covered

1. **Group Creation**: Alice creates a new MLS group (epoch 0).
2. **Adding Bob**: Alice adds Bob to the group with an Add proposal and Commit (epoch 1).
3. **Bob Joins**: Bob joins the group using the Welcome message (epoch 1).
4. **Removing Bob**: Alice removes Bob from the group with a Remove proposal and Commit (epoch 2).
5. **Bob Processes Removal**: Bob processes the removal commit and is removed from the group (epoch 2).

## Key Concepts

- **Remove Proposal**: A proposal to remove a member from the group, identified by their leaf index.
- **Commit**: Applies the removal and advances the group epoch.
- **Welcome Message**: Used for joining, not for removal. Removed members do not receive a new Welcome.

  welcome: addBobCommitResult.welcome!.welcome,
  keyPackage: bob.publicPackage,
  privateKeys: bob.privatePackage,
  ratchetTree: aliceGroup.ratchetTree,
})

// Alice removes Bob, transitioning to epoch 2
const removeBobProposal: Proposal = {
  proposalType: defaultProposalTypes.remove,
  remove: { removed: 1 }, // Bob's leaf index
}
const removeBobCommitResult = await createCommit({
  context,
  state: aliceGroup,
  extraProposals: [removeBobProposal],
})
aliceGroup = removeBobCommitResult.newState
removeBobCommitResult.consumed.forEach(zeroOutUint8Array)

// Bob processes the removal and is removed from the group (epoch 2)
const bobProcessRemoveResult = await processMessage({
  context,
  state: bobGroup,
  message: removeBobCommitResult.commit,
})
bobGroup = bobProcessRemoveResult.newState
bobProcessRemoveResult.consumed.forEach(zeroOutUint8Array)
```

### What to Expect

- After running this scenario, Alice remains in the group, and Bob is removed.
- The group epoch increments with each commit, reflecting the addition and removal of members.
- Bob's state will indicate he is no longer a member after processing the removal commit.
